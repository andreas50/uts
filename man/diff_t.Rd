\title{Rolling Differences}
\usage{
diff_t(x, ...)

\method{diff_t}{uts}(x, by = NULL, scale = "abs", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a time series object.}

\item{by}{a finite \code{\link[lubridate]{duration}} object, specifying over which time horizon to calculate differences in observation values.}

\item{scale}{on which scale to calculate differences. Either \code{"abs"} for absolute differences \code{x_t - x[t - by]}, \code{"rel"} for relative differences \code{x_t / x[t - by] - 1}, or \code{"log"} for logarithmic differences \code{log(x_t / x[t - by])}.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments passed to or from methods.}
}
\description{
Return a time series with differences over a fixed time horizon.
}
\details{
The time series difference at observation time \code{t} for time horizon \code{by} is calculated between the values \code{x_t} and \code{x[t - by]} on a suitable scale. Here, \code{x[t - by]} is the sampled value of \code{x} at time \code{t - by}, see \code{\link{sample_values}}.

Observations times for which no difference can be calculated (i.e. times \code{t_i} with \code{t_i - by < t_1}) are dropped from the output.

\note{
For an evenly spaced time series, calculating differences over (1) a certain number of observations (e.g. over four observations for quarterly data), and (2) over a fixed time horizon (e.g. over one year) gives the same result. For unevenly spaced time series, however, these two operations are quite different.

\examples{
diff_t(ex_uts(), by=ddays(1))
diff_t(ex_uts(), by=ddays(5)) # an empty time series, because the time difference is too large
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{diff}} allows to calculate differences over a fixed \emph{number of observations}, as opposed to \emph{time horizon}.
