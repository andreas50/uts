\usage{
previous_weekday(x, ...)

\method{previous_weekday}{POSIXt}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object representing dates.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments passed to or from methods.}
}
\value{
An object of the same class and length as the input \code{x}
}
\description{
For objects representing dates, find the previous weekday.
}
\details{
Substract the minimum number of days to reach a weekday (Monday-Friday). The time-of-day information is therefore unaffected. In particular, if the input already is a weekday, then the output is the same as the input.
