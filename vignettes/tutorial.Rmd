An Unevenly-spaced Time Series (uts) is a sequence of observation time and value pairs (tn, Xn) with strictly increasing observation times. As opposed to equally spaced time series, the spacing of observation times may not be constant.

## Comparison with other packages for irregular time series

| Time series operation           | In terms of observations | In terms of time units|
|---------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Get the length                  | length | length_t |
| Get initial subperiod           | head | head_t |
| Get terminal subperiod          | tail | tail_t |
| Delay observations              | lag | lag_t |
| Calculate differences over time | diff | diff_t |

## Recylcing rules

`R` uses a variety of rules for handling arithmetic between vectors and arrays of different lengths. These are commonly known as *recycling rules*, see Section 5.4.1 of "An introduction to R" for a complete list.

Arithmetic with `uts` objects only keeps a few rules that do not make strong implicit assumptions about what exactly the user wants to do. Specifically:

* `uts` objects are always recycled.
* Only `uts_vector` objects of length one are recycled.
