This document provides an overview of the internal functions of the `uts` package. These functions are typically to needed by ordinary users, but might be of interest to developers seeking the extend the package.

### Internal representation of `uts` objects

A `uts` object is a list of length two with class attribute `c("uts", "list")`. The two list entries are vectors of equal length and are called `values` and `times`.

The former is an `R` vector of arbitrary mode, containing the observation *values*. The latter is a `POSIXct` vector of strictly increasing observation *times*.
