Title: Unevenly Spaced Time Series
Author: Andreas Eckner <andreas@eckner.com>

Depends: R (>= 3.1), lubridate
Suggests: testthat
Description: This package provides S3 classes for constructing, analyzing, and manipulating
  univariate unevenly-spaced time series. Individual time series can store arbitrary R objects.
  R users familiar with vectors, matrices, and data frames will find it is easy to work with the
  corresponding time series objects, because the usage of many functions ([, [[, length, etc.) is
  completely analogous.
