Description: This package provides S3 classes for constructing, analyzing, and
    manipulating univariate unevenly-spaced time series. Individual time series
    can store arbitrary R objects. R users familiar with vectors, matrices, and
    data frames will find it is easy to work with the corresponding time series
    objects, because the usage of many functions ([, [[, length, etc.) is
    completely analogous.
