Description: An S3 class for constructing, analyzing, and manipulating
    univariate unevenly spaced time series (uts). A time series can store
    arbitrary R objects. R users familiar with vectors and matrices should find
    it straightforward to work with the corresponding time series objects,
    because the usage of many functions (such as [, [[, length, etc.) is
    completely analogous.
