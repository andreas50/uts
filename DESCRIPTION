Description: This package provides S3 classes for constructing, analyzing, and
    manipulating univariate unevenly spaced time series. Individual time series
    can store arbitrary R objects. R users familiar with vectors, matrices, and
    data frames should find it is straightforward to work with the corresponding
    time series objects, because the usage of many functions
    (such as [, [[, length, etc.) is completely analogous.
